Plugin features
=================

Here, we showcase several plugin packages. See :doc:`api_plugin` for more details.
The plugin packages are automatically loaded if they are installed in the same
environment as the *mrfmsim* package.

Unit Plugin
----------------------

`mrfmsim-unit <https://github.com/Marohn-Group/mrfmsim-unit>`_ 
plugin is a package that handles units and unit conversions for
the *mrfmsim* base unit system. The plugin is installed by default.

The plugin is based on the `pint
<https://pint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ package, and provides
a registry with *mrfmsim* base units pre-defined. The quantity also
has quick conversion method ``to_base_units()`` to convert to the
base units.

.. code:: python

    from mrfmsim_unit.unit import MRFMUnitRegistry

    mureg = MRFMUnitRegistry()
    a = 0.1 * mureg.micrometer
    b = 1.0 * mureg.nanometer

    >>> a * b
    0.1 nm Âµm

    >>> (a * b).to_base_units()
    100.0 nm^2

    >>> # (a * b).to_base_units().magnitude
    >>> # (a * b).base_magnitude
    >>> (a * b).bm
    100.0

The *mrfmsim* components do not accept ``pint.Quantity``. Only the magnitude
should be supplied to the components. The plugin provides a ``getattr`` method
to access the quantity with units.

.. code:: python

    magnet = SphereMagnet(radius=50.0, mu0_Ms=1800.0, origin=[0.0, 0.0, 50.0])
    r = mureg.getattr(magnet, "radius")
    
    >>> r
    50.0 nm
    >>> r ** 2
    2500.0 nm^2

Command line interface plugin
------------------------------

The command line interface is provided by the `mrfmsim-cli
<https://github.com/Marohn-Group/mrfmsim-cli>`__ plugin.
The plugin is installed by default.

To view the CLI options::

    mrfmsim --help

To show the experiment metadata::

    mrfmsim --exp name_of_exp metadata

To draw the experiment graph::

    mrfmsim --exp name_of_exp visualize

Three-dimensional plot plugin
------------------------------

To facilitate the visualization of three-dimensional experiment results, for example,
the magnetic field, polarization, and signal distribution, we created the
`mrfmsim-plot <https://github.com/Marohn-Group/mrfmsim-plot>`_ plugin that provides
conversion from the experiment data to the 
`mayavi mlab <http://docs.enthought.com/mayavi/mayavi/mlab.html>`_ and 
`PyVista <https://docs.pyvista.org/version/stable/>`_ data objects.

Experiment geometry
=============================

For experiments in the *mrfmsim*, two experimental geometries
are used: "hangdown" and SPAM (springiness preservation by aligning magnetization).
The two geometries are shown in the figure below.

In the "hangdown" geometry, the sample surface is in the :math:`xy`-plane, the
cantilever oscillates in the :math:`x`-direction. In the SPAM geometry, the
sample surface is in the :math:`xz`-plane, and the
cantilever oscillates in the :math:`x`-direction. The external field for both
geometries is applied in the :math:`z`-direction.

See `coordinates <https://marohn-group.github.io/mrfmsim-docs/coordinates.html>`_
for the definition of the coordinate system.
